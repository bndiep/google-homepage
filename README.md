Things I need to relearn or practice:
1) Making a new repository in GIT
2) Moving the repository into my local machine -- use git clone and then add the SSH link
3) Remember to then change the directory to that repository folder that you will adding to
4) Use the touch command to add a new text file
5) The entire working directory, staging area, and commit process

These are important skills for when you will be only using UNIX in your daily work.

What I want to accomplish from this project:
1) Pracitice how to alter a webpage
2) Practice how to make a proper layout for a webpage
3) Try to recall all the information I have learned about HTML and CSS in the last few month without completely relying on the Internet as a reference
4) Produce a website that I can proud of (considering that there is still so much to learn at this point)
5) Most importantly, learn how to use the terminal to make modify, stage, and commit my files to the repository

What I DID accomplish at the end of the project:
